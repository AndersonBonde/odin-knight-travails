This repo is a The Odin Project(TOP) exercise to practice using search algorithms on a real problem.

The goal is to use a  data structure that's similar to a binary tree and build a function that shows the shortest possible way to get the knight(chess piece) to move from one square to another outputting all squares it will stop along the way.
